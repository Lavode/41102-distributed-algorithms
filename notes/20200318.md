# Regular register in fail-stop model

- Fail-stop model:
  - Synchronous
  - Perfect failure detector P

- Goal: Implement (1, N) regular register `onrr`
- Specifically: System where each process keeps a copy of the data. Read
  returns local value, write writes to all
- Challenges: Individual processes can be disconnected, or fail, yet the
  register must remain regular.
- Writer must not terminate before write to last healthy process finished

```
init:
  val := nil
  correct := Pi // Only in writero

UPON <onrr, Write | v>:
  send [WRITE, v] to all p in Pi # Best effort broadcast

  wait for [ACK] from all p in correct

  TRIGGER <onrr, WriteResp.>

UPON receive [WRITE, v'] from w:
  val := v
  send [ACK] to w

UPON <P, crash | c> do:
  correct := correct \ {c}

UPON <onrr, Read> do:
  TRIGGER <onrr, ReadReturn | val>
```

# Regular register in fail-silent model (4.2 in textbook)

```
init:
  ts  := nil
  val := nil
  wts := 0 # Only writer
  rid := 0

upon <onrr, Write | v>:
  wts := wts + 1
  send [WRITE,, wts, v] to all p in Pi

  wait for [ACK, ts'] such that ts' = wts from > N/2 processes

upon [WRITE, ts', v'] from w do:
  if ts' > ts:
    (ts, val) := (ts', v')

  send [ACK, ts'] to w

UPON <onrr, Read>:
  rid := rid + 1
  send [READ, rid] to all p in Pi

  wait for [VAL, r, ts', v'] such that r = rid from > N/2 processes

  j := value v in messages with highest timestamp ts'

  trigger <onrr, ReadReturn | j>

UPON [READ, r] FROM p:
  # r which is sent back allows mapping response (VAL) to request (READ)
  send [VAL, r, ts, val] to p
```

## Making this algorithm atomic

- (1, N) atomic register (onar)

Changes:
```
UPON <onar, Read>:
  rid := rid + 1
  send [READ, rid] to all p in Pi

  wait for [VAL, r, ts', v'] such that r = rid from > N/2 processes

  (rts, rval) := pair in messages with highest timestamp ts'

  # Ensures no subsequent read
  send [RWRITE, rts, rval] to all p in Pi
  wait for [RACK, r'] such that r' = rts from > N/2 processes

  trigger <onar, ReadResponse | rval>

UPON [RWRITE, ts', v'] from r:
  if ts' > ts:
    (ts, val) := (ts', v')

  send [RACK, ts'] to r
```

# Recipe: Making regular register atomic

- Two steps
  1) (1, N) regular => (1, 1) atomic
  2) (1, 1) atomic => (1, N) atomic

## Transformation: From (1, 1) atomic to (1, N) atomic


High-level notation, rather than specific async algorithm.
```
Implements: (1, N) atomic register onar
Uses: (1, 1) atomic register (n^2, ooar.i.j) # uses n^2 registers, think of a 2d plane / blackboard


init:
  ts := 0

operation onar-Write(v):
  ts := ts + 1
  for p in Pi do:
    # w is writer process
    ooar.p.w-Write((ts, v))

operation onar-Read():
  readlist := {}
  for p in Pi do:
    readlist[p] = ooar.self.p-Read()

  (maxts, val) := highest(readlist)

  # Notify others
  for p in Pi do:
    ooar.p.self-Write((maxts, maxval))

  return maxval
```

- Writer uses highest timestamp that it reads
- - timestamps become (ts, index) tuples, `index` being index of process (?)

# Register implementation in byzantine model

- Byzantine model: Processes can do arbitrary things, eg respond faulty rather
  than just crash, even on purpose.
- Byzantine model: N > 3F

Consider:
- One writer, constantly writing new values 'a', 'b', 'c', ...
- 1 reade
- 6 more processes (only storing data in this example), two of which are byzantine

- If updates arrive in 4 'good' processes staggered, they might each return a
  different value if reader reads from them, allowing two byzantine readers
  (who might both output 'x') to get a 'majority' win (majority here = biggest
  number of votes for one value)

- No way to fix, without either
  a) relaxing specification to only ask for safe rather than regular semantics during reads with concurrent writes
  b) assuming extra power for the writer, eg digital signatures
