# Distributed cryptography (aka threshold cryptosystems)

Goal: Group of nodes able to keep secret (eg private key) shared between them.

- Threshold cryptosystems implement a regular crypto scheme (digital
  signatures, public-key cryptosystems, pseudo-random functions) in a
  distributed system, tolerating faulty processes.
- Some distributed cryptosystems can help implement distributed computing
  primitives

## Secret sharing

- `(f + 1)`-out-of-N secret sharing scheme
- Dealer distributes 'shares' to `P = {p_1 ... p_n}`
- Any group of f + 1 processes in P can recover the secret
- Any group of f or fewer processes have no information about s

### Polynomial secret sharing (shamir)

- `s in F_q` secret (`F_q` finite field)
- Dealer D chooses a random polynomial of degree f over `F_q`, such that `a(0) = s`
  eg `a(x) = sum (j = 0 to f): a_j * x^j`, where `a_0 = s`, `a_j in F_q` for `j = 1, ..., f`
- Give `a(i) to p_i`
- To recover `s`, a group `S subset P` of `f + 1` processes use lagrange interpolation to get:
  `S = a(0) = sum (i in S) lamabda^s_{0, i}`
  Where `lambda^s_{0, i} = Product (j in S, j != i) j / (j-i)`

#### Why is this secure?

Any group of `<= f` processes ('cheaters') have no information about s, because
every possible value `s*` in `F_q` for the missing share would result in a
different secret (all equally likely).

Compare perfect security of OTS.

## Threshold cryptosystems using a pseudorandom function

General idea:
- Secret key `x` is shared between processes.
- Many operations are possible

## Discrete-log based cryptosystems

- Group `G = <g>`, generator g, of order `q`, `|G| = q`

### Discrete log problem (DLP)

Given `y in G`, compute `x` such that `g^x = y` (`x in Z_q`)

### Diffie-Hellman Problem (DHP)

Given `y_1`, `y_2`, compute `g^{x1 * x2}`, where `y_1 = g^{x_1}`, `y_2 =
g^{x_2}`.

In practice, `G subset Z_p`, where `|p| ~ 2000`, p is prime, and `q | p - 1`.

These problems are assumed to be computationally intractable.

## Pseudorandom function

- `F_x: {0, 1}^* -> {0, 1}^k`
- Secret key x
- "Outputs look random, unless one knows x"
- Cannot distinguish between random k-bit string and `F_x(z)` for any given z

### DL-based PRF

- Uses hash function `H: {0, 1}^* -> G`
- Second hash function `H': G -> {0, 1}^k`
- Cryptographically strong hash functions
- For security, assume H outputs a random value in `G` for each input
- Secret key `x in F_q`
- `F_x(y) = H'(H(y)^x)`, with `H(y) in G`

### Threshold PRF

- Dealer picks `x in F_q` randomly
- Use secret sharing to produce share `x_i` for `p_i`
- Alternatively produce x using a distributed key generation protocol (DKG)
  among p_1 ... p_n

Threshold cryptosystems exist for:
- ElGamal encryption (DLP)
- RSA signatures / encryption
- More cryptosystems

Threshold PRF can implement the common coin primitive in randomized byzantine
consensus.
