# Notion of causality

`m_1 -> m_2` when one of:
- Process broadcast `m_1` before it broadcasts `m_2`
- Some process delivers `m_1` and later broadcasts `m_2`
- Some message `m_3` exists such that `m_1 -> m_3` and `m_3 -> m_2`

# Casual-order broadcast using vector clocks

- Vector clock in message: Keeps track of how many messages from another
  process have to be delivered before this process has caught up to the causal
  past of this message.

```
init:
  V := [0]^n
  lsn := 0
  pending := {}

upon <crb, Broadcast | m> do:
  W := V
  W[rank(self)] := lsn
  lsn++
  trigger <rb, Broadcast | [W, m]>

upon <rb, Deliver | p, [W, m]> do:
  pending := pending U {[p, W, m]}

  while exists (p', W', m') in pending && W' <= V:
    pending := pending \ {[p', W', m']}
    V[rank(p')]++
    trigger <crb, Deliver | p', m'>
```

# Total-order broadcast (chapter 6.7 in textbook)

## Total-order broadcast

Reliable broadcast with the following total-order property:
- For two messages `m_1` and `m_2` such that `p` and `q` have delivered both
  messages each, then `p` delivers `m_1` before `m_2` IFF `q` delivers `m_1`
  before `m_2`.

## Consensus

Set of processes agreeing on a value.

```
Events:
  Input:
    <c, Propose | v> proposes v
  Output:
    <c, Decide | v> decide for v

Properties:
  Termination: Every correct process eventually decides some value
  Validity: If a process decides a value v, then v was proposed by some process
  Integrity: A process decides at most once
  Agreement: No two correct processes decide on different values
```

## From consensus to total-order broadcast

```
init:
  unordered := {}
  delivered := {}
  r := 1
  wait := False

upon <tob,  Broadcast | m> do:
  trigger <rb, Broadcast | m>

upon <rb, Deliver | p, m> do:
  if m not in unordered:
    unordered := unordered U {(p, m)}

upon unordered != {} && !wait:
  wait := True
  initialise consensus cr
  trigger <cr, Propose | unordered>

upon <cr, Decide | d>:
  # Order decided for all processes by consensus
  for (s, m) in d, in some fixed order:
    trigger <tob, Deliver | s, m>
    delivered := delivered U {m}
    unordered := unordered \ {(s, m)}
  r := r + 1
  wait := False
```

Properties:
- Validity (total-order broadcast):
- No duplicatoin:
- Agreement
- Total-order

Hence shown how to get from consensus to total-order broadcast.

## From TOB to consensus 

- Process `p` proposes `x` by broadcasting `x`, forall p
- First value delivered (which is same for all processes) will be decided

Hence two primitives are equal

# State-machine replication

- State goes in
- Command is executed
- Output produced
- State comes out
- Chainable

```
Events:
  <rsm, Execute | command>
  <rsm, Output | response>

Properties:
  Agreement: All correct processes output the same sequence o responses
  Termination: If a correct process executes a command, then the process
    eventually outputs a response (for this command)
```

Implementation using TOB
```
init:
  state := nil

upon <rsm, Execute | cmd>:
  trigger <tob, Broadcast | cmd>

upon <tob, Deliver | p, cmd>:
  r, state := F(cmd, state)
  trigger <rsm, Output | r>
```
