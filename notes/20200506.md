# Recap

- Impossibility of async consensus with one crash-faulty process
- Circumvent with randomized consensus

Today: Byzantine consensus -> Byzantine reliable broadcasts -> Byzantine total-order broadcasts


# Weak Byzantine consensus

```
Events:
  propose(v)
  decide(v)

Properties:
  Termination: Every *correct* process eventually decides
  Weak validity: 
    If all processes are correct, and all propose v, then no correct process
    decides a value different from v; 
    If all process are correct and some correct process decides v, then v was
    proposed by some process
  Agreement:
    No two correct processes decide a different value
```

# Strong Byzantine consensus

```
Same as weak byzantine consensus, but with strong validity:

Properties:
  Strong validity:
    If all correct processes propose the same value v, then every correct process decides v;
    Otherwise, a correct process must decide a special value `nil`, or a value
    proposed by a correct process.
```

## Special case: Binary consensus

```
Strong validity: The decision value was proposed by a correct process.
```

Simplification because there are only two decision values

## Fault Tolerance

Byzantine consensus requires a strong majority.

### Proof

Suppose not. Consider f = 1, then there is a byzantine consensus protocol for N
= 3 processes.

Consider the following executions

Execution A:
TODO `20200506_1.png`

Execution B:
TODO `20200506_2.png`

Execution C:
TODO `20200506_3.png`


One can extend this argument to N > 3 processes, as long as `N <= 3F`.

# Reliable broadcasts with byzantine faults

```
Events:
  broadcast(m) // Only sender
  deliver(m)

Properties:
  Validity: If a correct sender s broadcasts m, then every correct process
    eventually delviers m.
  No duplication: ...
  Integrity: ...
  Consistency: If a correct process delivers m, and another correct process
    delivers m', then m = m'.
```

This byzantine broadcast can broadcast and deliver only one payload message;
with identified sender s.

To broadcast multiple payloads, run many such protocols in parallel.

# Signed echo broadcast

```
init:
  sentecho := False
  sentfind := False

upon <cb, broadcast | m>:
  send [SEND, m] to all processes

upon [SEND, m] from s AND !sentecho:
  sigma := sign(ECHO || identifier || m)
  send [ECHO, m, sigma] to s

upon [ECHO, m, sigma'] from > (N+F)/2 distinct processes, and !sentfinal:
  Sigma := list of received signatures
  send [FINAL, m, Sigma]
  sentfinal := True

upon [FINAL, m, Sigma]:
  if verify that Sigma > (N+F)/2 valid signatures:
    deliver(m)
```

## Consistency

- Some p has delivered m, then it has `> (N+F)/2` signatures on m
- Some p' has delivered `m'`, then it has seen `> (N+F)/2` signatures on `m'`

How many distinct correct processes have signed?
- p has seen `> (N-F)/2` signatures on m for correct processes
- p' has seen `> (N-F)/2` signatures on `m'` for correct processes

This means p and p' together have seen `> N - F` signatures from correct processes.


As there are only (at least?) `N - F` correct processes, we can conclude that m = m'.

## Implementation without signatures

This protocol uses signatures. An alternative protocol uses point-to-point
messages, where signatures are replaced by messages.

# Byzantine reliable broadcast (Bracha)

Often called Bracha, by its creator.

## Def

```
A protocol for byzantine reliable broadcast is a byzantine consistent broadcast
which also satisfies:

Totality: If a correct proc delivers some message, then every correct proc
  eventually delivers some message.
```

Totality + consistency = reliability.


## Implementation: Authenticated double-echo broadcast

TODO: `20200506_5.png`

- All correct processes send `[READY, m]` upon receiving `> (N+F)/2` `ECHO` messages with `m`
- All correct processes also send `[READY, m]` after receiving `>F` `READY` messages with `m`
- A correct proc delivers m upon receiving `>2F` `[READY, m]` messages

This ensures totality, as:

- p delivering m ensures it has received more than `2F` READY messages with m.
- More than F READY messages are from correct processes
- Every correct process eventually receives `>F` READY messages with m
- Every correct process eventually sends `READY` with m
- Every correct process eventually receives `>2F` READY messages and delivers
- Because `N - F > 2F` as per the assumption that `N > 3F`

# Broadcasting many payload messages

- Run one instance of basic broadcast for each process as a sender (in parallel)
- When one delivers, open a new one
=> Byzantine reliable / consistent broadcast channel

# Byzantine total-order broadcast

- Analogous to model with crash failures
- In principle, implemented from consensus instance for each round as before (GCR11, 6.2)
- In practice, more complex protocols are used, which are efficient (PBFT protocol)

# Byzantine consensus in fail silent model (async)

- Uses randomization
- Random coin via:
  - Threshold crypto
  - Secret sharing
