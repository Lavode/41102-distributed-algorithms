# Consensus

Remember models:
- Synchronous protocol (fail-stop)
- Eventually synchronous protocol (fail-noisy)
- Asynchronous (fail-silent) => Consensus here requires randomization, see next lecture

## Definition

```
Events:
  Input:
    propose(v)

  Output:
    decide(v)

  Properties:
    Termination: Every process terminates
    Validity: The decided-upon value was proposed by at least one process
    Integrity: Processes decide at most once
    Agreement: No two processes decide different values
```

## Flooding uniform consensus: Uniform consensus in fail-stop model

Idea: Flood N times all proposals. After N rounds, due to BEB, all correct
processes will have all proposals. Then use a deterministic ordering.

```
init:
  correct := Pi
  round := 1
  decision := nil
  proposals := {}
  received:= {}

upon <uc, propose | v>:
  proposals := proposals U {v}
  # 1 = initial round
  trigger <beb, broadcast | [PROPOSE, 1, proposals]>

upon <P, crash | p>:
  correct = correct \ {p}

upon <beb, deliver | p, [PROPOSE, r, ps]>:
  if r = round:
    received := received U {p}
    proposals := proposals U ps

upon correct subset of received and decision = nil:
  if round < N:
    round := round + 1
    received := {}
    trigger <beb, broadcast | [PROPOSE, round, proposals]>
  else:
    // round = N
    // Any deterministic sorting, eg min, max, alphabetic, ...
    decision := sort(proposals)[0]
    trigger <uc, decide | decided)>
```

Will not work with eg eventually perfect failure detector, as process might be
excluded from updates.

## Consensus protocol with eventual synchrony

- Consensus mechanism inside PAXOS, viewstamped replication, zookeeper, raft
- More complex than fail-stop protocol with perfect failure detector because it uses omega (delta-P)

Idea:
- Epochs: Numbered (increasing) slots of time.
- Epoch change if Omega detects (suspects) failure
- Every epoch has its leader
- Epoch will terminate if leader is correct

Components:
  1) Consensus protocol nc // Consensus
  2) Epoch change ec // Consensus when to change epoch
  3) Epoch consensus ep // consensus within epoch

```
Epoch-change:

Event:
  <ec, StartEpoch | ts, l>

Properties:
  Monotonicity: If a process starts epoch (ts, l), and subsequently starts
    epoch (ts', l') then ts' > ts
  Consistency: If a process starts epoch (ts, l), and another process starts
    epoch (ts', l') then ts = ts' => l = l'. Ie consensus on which leader at
    given time.
  Leadership:
    - There is a last epoch that is started at every process.
    - The leader of this last epoch is correct
```

```
Epoch-consensus ep with (ts, l)

Event:
  Input:
    <ep, Propose | v> // Only leader
    <ep, Abort>
  Output:
    <ep, Decide | v>
    <ep, aborted | state>

Properties:
  Validity: If a process ep-decides v, then v was ep-proposed (by the leader)
    in some epoch ts' <= ts
  Agreement: As before
  Integrity: As before
  Termination: If the leader l of epoch ts is correct, and no process aborts,
    then every correct process eventually ep-decides.
  Lock-in: If a process has ep-decided v in epoch ts' < ts, then no process
    ep-decides for a value different from v.
```

### Leader-driven consensus (nc)

```
init:
  val := nil
  proposed := False
  decided := False

  init ep-consensus with (0, l_0) [ep.0]
  (ets, l) := (0, l_0)

upon <nc, propose | v> do:
  val : v

upon <ec, StartEpoch | nts, nl>:
  (newts, newl) := (nts, nl)
  // Shorthand for Abort event
  abort(ets, l) 

upon <ep.ts, Aborted | state>:
  (ets, l) := (newts, newl)
  initialize ep-consensus with state and (ets, l0)

upon val != nil and l = self and proposed = False do:
  proposed := True
  trigger <ep.ets, Propose | val>

upon <ep.ts, Decide | v>:
  if not decided:
    decided := True
    trigger <uc, Decide | v>
```

#### Agreement

- p nc-decides v
- q nc-decides v'

- If in same epoch, then ep-consensus agreement property guarantees v = v'
- Otherwise, lockin property ensures agreement property

#### Validity

### Implementing ep-consensus using read/write ep.consensus (ets, l) assuming N > 2F

```
init (with state = (valts, val)):

upon <ep, Propose | v>:
  // Only done by leader
  tupval := v
  trigger <beb, broadcast | [READ]>

upon <beb, deliver | p, [READ]>:
  // p is leader
  send [STATE, valts, val] to p

upon <pl, receive | p, [STATE, valts, val]> from > N/2 processes:
  // Only done by leader
  (ts, v) := val from any of STATE msgs, with highest valts

  if v != nil:
    tmpval := v

  trigger <beb, broadcast | [WRITE, tmpval]>

upon <beb, deliver | p, [WRITE, v]>:
  // p is leader
  (valts, val) := (ets, v)
  send [ACCEPT] to p

upon <pl, receive | p, [ACCEPT]> from > N/2 processes:
  // Only done by leader
  trigger <beb, broadcast | [DECIDE, tmpval]>

upon <beb, deliver | p, [DECIDE, tmpval]>
  // p is leader
  trigger <ep, decide | v>
```

### Epoch-change

Details in book, algorithm 5.5, using leader-election oracle (eventually perfect FD) omega.
