# 4) Reliable broadcasts

In crash-stop model. Goal: A message m is delivered to all processes, or to
none at all.

```
IN:
  <Broadcast | m> Broadcast a message m

OUT:
  <Deliver | p, m> Deliver message m from sender p
```

## Unreliable / best-effort broadcast

```
Def:
  Validity: If a process broadcasts a message m, then every correct process eventually delivers m
  No duplication: No message is delivered more than once
  No creation: If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by s
    Via eg UUIDs, 128-bit random string
    Or identifier constructed from sender and sequence number

Implementation:
  for p in Pi do:
    send msg [m] to p
```

Crashes can cause messages to not be delivered, no reliability.

## Reliable broadcast

```
Def:
  Same properties as unreliable broadcast, plus
  Agreement: If a message m is delivered by a correct process, then every
    correct processes eventually delivers m.
    Limitation on correct processes ensures that if eg a sending process
    crashes right after it delivered to itself, but did not send out to others,
    we are ok with its message not being delivered to others.
```

### Implementation: Eager reliable broadcast

Every process which delivers a message (for the first time) broadcasts it.
```
init:
  delivered := {}

upon <rb, Broadcast | m> do:
  send [DATA, self, m] to all p in Pi

upon [DATA, s, m] from q do:
  if m not in delivered:
    delivered = delivered U {m}
    send [DATA, s, m] to all p in Pi
    trigger <rb, Deliver | s, m>
```

Implementation: RB uses BEB use P2P-Link.


How adequate is this basic reliable broadcast?
Assume p, q, r.
- p broadcasts m, delivers m to itself, crashes
- q delivers m, crashes
- r as sole correct process is not required to deliver anything, and will not receive anything (as the others crashed)
Issue: If delivery causes side-effects (eg storage on disk)

## Uniform reliable broadcast

```
Def:
  Like regular reliable broadcast, plus
  Uniform agreement: If *any* process delivers  a message m, then every *correct* process eventually delivers m.
```

Eager reliable broadcast does not fulfill this, as processes might crash after
they delivered, and messages lost.

### Implementation

In async network with `f < 2N` crashes.
```
init:
  // hash of message -> set
  ack[] := {}
  pending := {}
  delivered := {}

upon <urb, Broadcast | m> do:
  pending = pending U {(self, m)}
  send [DATA, self, m] to all p in Pi

upon [DATA, s, m] from q do:
  ack[m] := ack[m] U {q}
  if (s, m) not in pending:
    pending = pending U {(s, m)}
    send [DATA, s, m] to all p in Pi

upon (s, m) in pending && m not in delivered && |ack[m]| > N/2 do:
  delivered = delivered U {m}
  trigger <urb, Deliver | s, m>
```

If `q` delivers `m`, it has received `DATA` messages with that `m` from more
than `N/2` processes. As there are `f < N /2` faulty processes, there was at
least one correct processes in there, who has also sent it to all other
processes.

All correct processes eventually send a DATA message containing m, and hence
eventually deliver it.

## FIFO order broadcast

per-sender order.

Interface: Same as reliable bc

Properties:
  - Validity
  - No duplicates
  - No creation
  - Agreement
  - FIFO-Order: If process broadcasts m1 and subsequently m2, then no process
    delivers m2 unless it delivered m1 earlier.

### Implementation

- Each process as a local sequence number to evey payload message.
- For each sender, every receiver delivers payload messages according to
  sequence number (requires buffering)

### Causal order (broadcast)

```
A: Do we use Skype or Zoom?

B: The first one (== Skype)
```

If C receives B's message before A's, causality is violated, as A's message was
the cause of B.

Preventing such violations:
- Send complete history of past delivered messages with each sent message
  (e-mail quote style), big overhead
- Keep a counter of messages for each sender

```
