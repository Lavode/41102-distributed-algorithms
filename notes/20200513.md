Today: Bunch of loosely connected topics

- Group membership
- Group communication systems (view synchrony)
- Gossip protocols
- Blockchain consensus

# Group membership

- Group composition changes
- Faults occur, process should be removed if crashed
- New processes should be able to join

## Formalization of group membership

```
Event:
  <gm, View | v> V = (id, M), M subset of P is a set of processes
    "process *installs* view V"

Properties:
  Monotonicity: If proc p installs view V = (id, M) and later installs view 
    V' = (id', M') then id' > id

  Agreement: If p installs view (id, M), and q installs view (id', M'), and 
    id = id', then M = M'

  Completness: If a process p crashes (respectively is added), then eventually every
    correct process installs a view V = (id, M) such that p not in M
    (respectively p in M)

  Accuracy: If some proc installs a view V = (id, M), 
      And p not in M (but p was in an earlier view), then p has crashed
      And p in M (but p was not in an earlier view), then p was added
```

Implementation:
  1) Implementation with consensus (see CGR11)
  2) Implementation from failure detectors (in practice)

## View-synchronous group communication

!TODO image in recording
  Blue circles: Established views
  Red: Messages

Communicate inside views:
- Simple to implement, because all processes inside view are 'live'

Eg reliable communication:
  Typically given only for processes that progress together from one view to
  the next

## Popular implementations

- JGroups, Java implementation
- ISIS

# Probabilistic broadcast

- Quorum-based protocols do not scale to large (1000s) of numbers of processes
  (only ~100s)
- Reason is that consistency implies lower bound on messages (communication
  bits) of Omega(N^2)
- Probabilisticy protocols ensure (agreement) their propertiies only for a
  large fraction of nodes

## Probabilistic reliable broadcast

- Similar to reliable broadcast with crash failures
- But validity only holds with high probability:
  Validity: If a process broadcasts a message m, then with probability at least
    1 - epsilon, every correct process eventually delivers m

## Protocols for probabilistic broadcast

### Eager probabilistic broadcast

(Push-style gossip)

```
Init:
  delivered := {}

Upon <pb, Broadcast | m> do:
  delivered := delivered U {m}
  trigger <pb, Deliver | self, m>
  gossip([GOSSIP, self, m, t]) // t = O(log N), 'hop count'

func gossip(m):
  for p in (set of k randomly chosen processes in Pi):
    lossy-send message m to p // In practice eg UDP

upon [GOSSIP, p, m, r] do:
  if m not in delivered:
    delivered := delivered U {m}
    trigger <pb, Deliver | p, m>

  if r > 1:
    gossip([GOSSIP, p, m, r - 1])
```

#### Efficiency

With `t = O(log N)` and constant fan-out k, this reaches all processes with
high probability.

!TODO `20200513_1.png`

- Push-only protocols have this limitation
- Practical protocols use push and pull ('lazy probabilistic broadcast' in textbook)

#### Pull-phase in Push-pull protocols:

- If a process p learns about existence of some message m that it has not
  delivered yet, then it 'pulls' the message: Sends out a request for its
  contents using push-style gossip
  If a process 'has' m and gets the gossip-request, it will send m in a
  point-to-point way to the requester p

- Processes store a faction of the delivered messages


# Blockchain consensus

**Now back to byzantine faults**

- Bitcoin introduced a novel type of consensu protocol called 'Nakamoto consensus'
- Model without knowledge of participants
- And with byzantine participants
- How to 'vote' in an open system?

Idea: Proof-of-work

## Proof-of-work

Puzzle which is solvable by everyone, with speed proportional to computational
power.

- Moderately hard puzzles
- Puzzles can be generated effortless, and are of equal difficulty
- Difficulty of puzzles can be controlled

```
Verifier V                                  Prover P

Picks challenge x randomly
                         ----- x ----->
                                            t := solution to x
                         <---- t -----
Verify that t solves x
```

### Properties of proof-of-work

1) P has no shortcut to find solution, must invest ~2^T steps
2) Many instances can be generated easily
3) V must be able to check solution t efficiently

### Implementation: PoW by hashing

- Cryptographic hash function `H: {0, 1}^* -> {0,1}^k`
- Difficulty: Number of (leading) bits `T` that must be 0
- Challenge: `x in {0, 1}^*`
- Solution: `t, such that H(x || t) < 2^{k - T}`

Prover has no strategy to find such a solution other than to try `O(2^T)`
inputs `t`.
