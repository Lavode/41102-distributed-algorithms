# Timing assumption

## 1) Asynchronous system

Logical clock creates a logical time ('counter')
- Each process `p` keeps a logical clock `l_p`
- When an event on `p` occurs, `p` increments its clock: `l_p := l_p + 1`
- When `p` sends a mesage to `q`, it attaches a timestamp `ts(m) = l_p` to the message `m`
- When `p` receives a message with `ts(m')`, then `p` sets `l_p := max{l_p, ts(m') } + 1`

### Happens-before relation

`e_1` happens before `e_2`, notation: `e_1 -> e_2` IFF

```
p ----- e_1 ----- e_2 -----
```
or
```
p ----- e_1 ---------------
              \
q --------------- e_2 -----
```
or
```
p ----- e_1 ---------------
              \
q --------------- e_2 -----
                     \
r ---------------------e_3-
```

That is to say one event *causes* another.

#### Lemma

`e_1` occurs in `p` at `l_p`, `e_2` occurs in `q` at `l_q`, then:

If `e_1 -> e_2`, then `l_p < l_q`

Other direction might not hold - eg speed of logical clocks does not have to be
identical.

## 2) Synchronous system

Either:
  - Assume every process has access to a real-time clock (RTC)

Or:
  - Synchronous comutation (bounds on computation time)
  - Synchronous communication (bounds on message transmission time)

Careful: When synchrony assumptions are needed for safety properties.

## 3) Partially synchronous model

- Synchronous most of the time
- Sometimes asynchronous, during which the algorithm must not violate safety
  properties

Formally captured by the assumption of an eventually synchronous system:
- Initial period of asynchrony
- After some point in time (unknown to algorithm) the system is synchronous

## Def: Perfect failure detector `P`

```
Event:
  <P.crash | p>: Process `p` was detected to have crashed

Properties:
  - Strong completness: Eventually every process that has crashed is detected by all
    correct processes. (Liveness property)
  - Strong accuracy: For any process `p`, if `p` detects that `q` has crashed,
    then `q` has actually crashed. (Safety property)
```

Formally: All processes are alive forever, or they crash and stop.
Suppose a nation of time in N:
  `C: N -> Pi`: C(t) is set of processes which are correct (=alive) at time `t`
  `F: N -> Pi`: F(t) is set of processes which are faulty (=crashed) at time `t`

As crashes are irreversible: `p \in F(t) => p \in F(t') forall t' >= t`

Reason for irreversible crashes: Perfect failure detector which doesn't make
mistakes.

`Pi` := Set of all processes
`F` (calligraph) := Set of all failed processes
`C` (calligraph) := Set of all correct processes

Then following formal definitions follow:

Strong completness:
```
Exists t : forall p in F forall q in C exists t' >= t : <P.Crash | p> occurs on process q at time t'
```

Strong accuracy:
```
Forall p in C: if <P.Crash | p> occurs on process q at time t, then p in F(t)
```

## Implementing P

```
UPON init:
  start timer Delta // Will timeout after Delta time, timer in sense of kitchen timer
  alive := Pi // Initialization condition, to not declare everyone crashed right away
  detected := {}

UPON timeout:
  for all p in Pi do:
    if p not in alive and p not in detected:
      trigger <P.Crash | p>
      detected << p

  alive := {}
  send [PING] to all p in Pi
  start timer with Delta

UPON receive [PING] from p:
  send [PONG] to p

UPON receive [PONG] from p:
  alive << p
```

Requires synchronous system, to ensure that all systems respond in time.

## Leader election

```
Event:
  <LE.Leader | p> Elects p to be leader

Properties:
  - Eventual leadership: Eventually some process l is elected leader by every correct process
  - Accruacy: If a process p is elected leader, then all the previously elected leaders have crashed
```

No implementation yet

## Eventual perfect failure detector

Notation: Diamond = eventual

```
Events:
  <Diamond P.suspect | p> Process p is suspected of having crashed
  <Diamond P.restore | p> Process p is throught to be active

Properties:
  Strong completness: Eventually, every process that has crashed is suspected by every correct process
  Eventual strong accuracy: Eventually every process that has crashed is suspected permanently by every correct process
```
