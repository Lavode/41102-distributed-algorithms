\section{Atomic register execution}

Let processes $\{p, q, r, s, t\}$ have ranks $\{5, 4, 3, 2, 1\}$ respectively.
In the following executions, assume messages between the processes which are not
mentioned to be delayed up to the point they are mentioned.

\subsection{Execution A}

Consider the following execution:

\begin{description}
	\item[$ts = 0$] $p$ sends $[WRITE, 1, 5, x]$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 0$] $q$ sends $[WRITE, 1, 4, y]$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 1$] $[WRITE, 1, 5, x]$ from $p$ arrives at $r$, is
		processed, corresponding $[ACK]$ is sent back.
	\item[$ts = 2$] $r$ starts read operation, stores $readval := x$
	\item[$ts = 2$] $r$ sends out write-back $[WRITE, 1, 5, x]$ to all
		processes
	\item[$ts = 3$] $[WRITE, 1, 4, y]$ from $q$ arrives at $s$, is
		processed, corresponding $[ACK]$ is sent back.
	\item[$ts = 4$] $s$ starts read operation, stores $readval := y$
	\item[$ts = 4$] $s$ sends out write-back $[WRITE, 1, 4, y]$ to all
		processes
	\item[$ts = 5$] All pending write-back messages are arrived and are
		processed. No matter the order, as the two timestamps of the
		writes of $p$ and $q$ are equal, all processes will now store
		$val = x, ts = 1, wr = 5$.
	\item[$ts = 5$] Read of $r$ terminates and returns $readval = x$. Read
		of $s$ terminates and returns $readval = y$.
	\item[$ts = 6$] All pending write messages by $p$ and $q$ arrive, are
		processed (being discarded as they do not contain more
		up-to-date information), corresponding $ACK$s are returned and
		processed.
	\item[$ts = 7$] Write operations of $p$ and $q$ terminate.
	\item[$ts = 8$] Non-concurrent read operation of $t$ commences as per
		the protocol, returns $readval = x$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Execution B}

Consider the following execution adapted from the one above, changes
highlighted in \textcolor{red}{red}. Specifically the messages which arrived
`early' were switched, with the message of writer $q$ arriving at $r$ early,
and the one of writer $p$ arriving at $s$ early.

\begin{description}
	\item[$ts = 0$] $p$ sends $[WRITE, 1, 5, x]$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 0$] $q$ sends $[WRITE, 1, 4, y]$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 1$] $\textcolor{red}{[WRITE, 1, 4, y]}$ from
		\textcolor{red}{$q$} arrives at $r$, is processed,
		corresponding $[ACK]$ is sent back.
	\item[$ts = 2$] $r$ starts read operation, stores $readval :=
		\textcolor{red}{y}$
	\item[$ts = 2$] $r$ sends out write-back $\textcolor{red}{[WRITE, 1, 4,
		y]}$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 3$] $\textcolor{red}{[WRITE, 1, 5, x]}$ from
		$\textcolor{red}{p}$ arrives at $s$, is processed,
		corresponding $[ACK]$ is sent back.
	\item[$ts = 4$] $s$ starts read operation, stores $readval :=
		\textcolor{red}{x}$
	\item[$ts = 4$] $s$ sends out write-back $\textcolor{red}{[WRITE, 1, 5,
		x]}$ to all processes
	\item[$ts = 5$] All pending write-back messages are arrived and are
		processed. No matter the order, as the two timestamps of the
		writes of $p$ and $q$ are equal, all processes will now store
		$val = x, ts = 1, wr = 5$.
	\item[$ts = 5$] Read of $r$ terminates and returns $readval =
		\textcolor{red}{y}$. Read of $s$ terminates and returns
		$readval = \textcolor{red}{x}$.
	\item[$ts = 6$] All pending write messages by $p$ and $q$ arrive, are
		processed (being discarded as they do not contain more
		up-to-date information), corresponding $ACK$s are returned and
		processed.
	\item[$ts = 7$] Write operations of $p$ and $q$ terminate.
	\item[$ts = 8$] Non-concurrent read operation of $t$ commences as per
		the protocol, returns $readval = x$.
