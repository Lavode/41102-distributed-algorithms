\section{Pizza or pasta?}

Given the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Every customer places at most one order at a time - for either
		pizza or pasta.
	\item The communication channel between customers, Alice, Bob and Carol
		is a perfect link
	\item Our algorithms have access to basic data structures such as hash
		maps and queues.
\end{itemize}

Then the following modules and algorithms describe an implementation providing
the requested properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Every customer will get his/her order delivered
	\item No dish is delivered if it was not ordered
	\item Every customer gets each order exactly once
\end{itemize}

		Indications:
		  <c.ready | customer>: Pasta for given customer is ready
		  <c.reject | customer>: Unable to prepare pasta for given customer as queue is full
		Properties:
		  Every submitted order is eventually rejected or finished
		  If an order was placed it is prepared exactly once
		  Only orders which are placed will be prepared

		  # FIFO queue of fixed size, supports .push, .pop and .size

\section{Safety and liveness}
\label{seq:safety_liveness}

\subsection{If some general attacks at time $t$, then the other general attacks at the same time.}
\label{seq:safety_property}

Consider an execution where general $B$ attacked at time $t$ yet general $A$
did not, as $m_2$ was either intercepted or delayed to the point of arriving
after $t$. Let the prefix execution $E'$ be the execution up to $t$. In any
extension thereof, general $A$ will still not attack at time $t$, as $m_2$ was
intercepted, or delayed up to that point in time.

Hence this is a safety property.

\subsection{If $m_2$ arrives after time $t$, then General $A$ will attack after General $B$}
\label{seq:no_unconfirmed_attack_safety}

This property ensures that general $A$ will only attack if a confirmation by
$B$ via means of $m_2$ is received, and not out of the blue, making it a safety
property.

More formally, consider an execution $E$ where $m_2$ has arrived after time
$t$, yet general $A$ and $B$ have attacked at time $t$. Clearly any extension
thereof will have the property violated still, as general $A$ having attacked
at the same time as general $B$ cannot be undone.

\subsection{Eventually, General B will attack.}

Consider an execution $E$ before $m_1$ arrived. At this point the property is
violated, as $m_1$ might be intercepted, so it's not yet guaranteed that
general $B$ will attack. An extension thereof where $m_1$ arrived will however
fulfil the property, making it a liveness property.

\subsection{If messengers $m_1$ and $m_2$ are not intercepted, then eventually both generals attack.}
\label{seq:liveness_property}

Consider an execution $E$ where the messengers are not intercepted. Consider a
prefix $E'$ at the time where $m_2$ arrived at general $A$. Any extension
thereof will have the two generals attacking eventually, making it a liveness
property.

\subsection{If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are not intercepted, then eventually both generals attack at time $t$.}

This property is a combination of the liveness and safety properties from sections
\ref{seq:liveness_property} and \ref{seq:safety_property}, making it have
properties of both a safety and liveness property.

\section{Unreliable clocks}

\subsection{Safety violations}

\subsubsection{First example}

\label{seq:no_unonfirmed_attack_safety}

Consider the scenario from exercise \ref{seq:safety_liveness}, with the
change that general B's clock is lagging behind general A's.

If $m_2$ arrives after time $t$, yet general B's clock is lagging enough,
general $A$ might still attack before general $B$, violating the safety
property \ref{seq:no_unconfirmed_attack_safety}.

\subsubsection{Second example}

Consider a system of automatic train carts. A central system is responsible for
the routing of carts to their destination, whereas each station has a local
system which is responsible for showing which cart will depart from which
platform. Both stations access a shared schedule, which defines which carts
depart from which platforms at what time. Assume that carts are always on time.

One possible safety property is then ``Every platform with a cart on it has the
cart's destination shown'', which is trivially violated if the two clocks are
out of sync.

\subsection{Liveness violations}

\subsubsection{First example}

Consider once more the scenario of exercise \ref{seq:safety_liveness}, with the
two generals' clocks not matching. Assuming $m_1$ and $m_2$ are not
intercepted, and arrive before time $t$, the liveness property
\ref{seq:liveness_property} is easily violated as, in spite of both wanting to
attack at time $t$, their mismatching clocks prevents both from attacking at
the same time.

\subsubsection{Second example}

Consider again the automatic train carts from before. One possible liveness
property is then ``A cart labelled with destination $A$ will eventually arrive
at destination $A$'', which is violated if, due to the mismatching clocks, the
cart on the platform labelled with $A$ is actually going to $B$.
