\section{Fast Byzantine consensus}

\subsection{Fast decision after $N - 2F$ correct messages}

A correct process in the fast byzantine consensus can fast decide if it
received $N - F$ identical proposals, of which at least $N - 2F$ proposals were
from correct processes. This requirement ensures the agreement property, as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any other fast-deciding process will also have received at least
		$N - 2F$ identical proposals from correct processes, of which
		any set of $N - 2F$ processes (under the assumptions of the
		algorithm) will overlap, guaranteeing agreement among
		fast-deciding processes,
	\item and any process which decides via regular byzantine consensus
		will receive at least $N - 2F$ proposals from correct
		processes, of which at least $N - 3F$ are identical, which will
		(again under the assumptions of the algorithm) be an absolute
		majority of received proposals, as shown below.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirement of $N > 5F$}

Consider the agreement property, which requires that no two correct processes
decide differently. Assume that a correct process $p$ fast-decides $v$, while
another correct process $q$ BC-decides (so via regular byzantine consensus).
Per the agreement property it must follow that $q$ has also decided for $v$.

As $p$ fast-decided $v$, it must have received $N - F$ proposals for $v$, of
which at least $N - 2F$ were from correct processes. As such there were at most
$F$ correct processes which might have proposed another value $v' \neq v$, of
which $p$ is not aware.

As $q$ BC-decided, it must have received $N - F$ proposals. Of these, at most
$2F$ can have been for $v'$: $F$ of the byzantine processes, and $F$ of those
correct processes which $p$ was not aware of. This implies that $q$ has
received at least $N - 3F$ proposals for $v$.

As $q$ will decide a value for which it receives $\frac{N - F}{2}$ proposals,
it must hold that more than half its received proposals are for $v$.

This is satisfied for $N > 5F$:
\[
	N - 3F \geq 2F + 1 > 2F + \frac{1}{2}
\]

But not for $N > 4F$, hence the requirement for $N > 5F$.
